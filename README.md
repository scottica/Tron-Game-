# Tron-Game-
This project implements a real-time TRON-style game on an FPGA using interrupt-driven C and inline RISC-V assembly. Hardware timer interrupts control gameplay timing, pushbutton interrupts handle input, and VGA graphics are rendered via memory-mapped video memory using pointer arithmetic.
